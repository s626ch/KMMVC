Kiddion's Modest Menu Version Checker

Simple project I made over school break to monitor Kiddion's Modest Menu for updates.

Requirements:
- Selenium
- discord.py
- asyncio
- win32gui
- chromedriver.exe in the folder of the script

This script was written as a proof of concept to run on Windows, I didn't polish it much, I just made sure it works.
